Requirement:

    Scan the entire app code, especially in app.py and any report-generation scripts.

    Locate any incorrect usage of self outside of class methods or in improperly structured functions.

    Wherever self is used:

        If inside a class, confirm it’s correctly defined via __init__ and method structure.

        If in a standalone function or global scope, remove or replace self. references by:

            Passing required variables explicitly as function parameters, or

            Refactoring the function into a class method if appropriate.

Deliverable:

    Correct the faulty code.

    Ensure:

        No use of self outside class methods.

        Report generation and file handling functions work without error.

        The app runs successfully upon Excel file upload and processes files to generate outputs.

Constraint:

    Do not alter the app’s UI layout or file upload method.

    Keep the structure suitable for clerical-level end users.
