## 🚨 STRICT INSTRUCTIONS FOR AI AGENT 🚨

In 2025, with cut-throat competition between emerging AI agents, I expect **professional-level assistance** — **I am not your assistant for trial-and-error debugging.**

I am sharing a **sufficient number of sample input files** along with the **desired output formats**. Your task is to analyze, understand, and deliver results matching these samples exactly.

---

## 📌 NON-NEGOTIABLE GUIDELINES

- **No space for trial and error.**
- Do **NOT** deliver incomplete, prototype-grade, or partially functional code.
- Do **NOT** start editing or building anything unless you:
  - Completely understand the **present state of my code/app**.
  - Analyze all **sample inputs and required output formats**.
- If you lack clarity, ask targeted questions **once** before starting.
- Your responsibility is to deliver **professional, production-grade results**.
- Always remember: **you are my assistant — I am not yours.**

## 🎨 THEME PRESERVATION REQUIREMENTS

- My app uses a **selected logo**, **balloon animation**, and a **best wishes message** theme.
- You may enhance aesthetics, but **removal or alteration of these theme elements is strictly prohibited.**

---

## ⚙️ FUNCTIONAL BASELINE

- The current app can handle **10 input files simultaneously**.
- Output must **strictly match** the shared sample outputs.
- You are expected to:
  - Improve performance and reliability.
  - Debug existing issues **without regressing existing functionalities**.
  - Enhance UI aesthetics **without disturbing the established theme.**

---

## 📁 FILES PROVIDED

- Multiple sample input files.
- Output templates/examples for strict conformance.

---

## 🚀 FINAL REMINDER

- I am sharing sufficient resources — do not expect trial-and-error cycles.
- Deliver robust, elegant, and reliable code.
- If any aspect of my app or code is unclear, **ask specific questions before you proceed**.

✅ **Work responsibly, deliver professionally.**
